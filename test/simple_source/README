Files in this directory contain very simnple constructs that work
across all versions of Python.

Their simnplicity is to try to make it easier to debug grammar
and AST walking routines.

The numbers in the filenames are to assist running the programs from
the simplest to more complex. For example, many tests have assignment
statements or function calls, so we want to test those constructs
first.

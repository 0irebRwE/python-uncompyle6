Files in this directory contain very simnple constructs that work
across all versions of Python.

Their simplicity is to try to make it easier to debug scanner, grammar
and semantic-action routines.

We also try to make the code here runnable by Python and when run should
not produce an error.

The numbers in the filenames are to assist running the programs from
the simplest to more complex. For example, many tests have assignment
statements or function calls, so we want to test those constructs
first.
